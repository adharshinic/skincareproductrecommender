In the vast skincare industry, choosing the proper products matched to individual needs might be difficult. The Skincare Product Recommendation System provides a solution by combining powerful machine learning and natural language processing techniques to generate individualized recommendations. Our algorithm provides customized recommendations based on user-specific skincare requirements, taking into account elements like skin type, tone, eye colour, and hair colour, by examining product descriptions, reviews, and ingredient lists. Our knowledge of skincare trends is improved by insights from category-based analysis and user demographics, which helps us provide suggestions that are more precise. After cleaning and transforming the data using text preprocessing techniques, word clouds and other visualizations are used to highlight recurring themes in the reviews. Furthermore, machine learning models that forecast skincare categories and identify goods with acceptable ingredients—like Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and SGD Classifier—ensure recommendation accuracy. By making recommendations for comparable products based on user ratings and ingredient similarity, content-based filtering improves the user experience even more. This customized strategy gives consumers the ability to choose skincare products wisely, producing the best possible outcomes. Our approach helps users make informed skincare decisions and encourages better skin by providing customized recommendations based on their preferences and objectives.
